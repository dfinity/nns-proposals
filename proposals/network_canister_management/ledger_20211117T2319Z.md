## Summary

Updating Ledger to Wasm module with hash `61a312e4bf4f86899edabf6b3cedc504b2b0825d9b7956abea65582095692a9a` built from git commit `88d24e7def3b6ef41508d753f4037dd76d940a6d`.

## Rationale

Community motion 20588 requested that all principals including canisters should be able to transfer ICP. This update contains the changes required to allow all canisters to transfer ICP by sending messages to the Ledger canister:

  * The ledger no longer checks against a whitelist when it decides whether to allow the caller to make a transfer.
    All principals except for the anonymous are allowed to transfer ICP now.

  * The ledger exposes 2 new Candid endpoints: `account_balance` and `transfer` (see the full Candid interface below).
    More Candid endpoints (e.g., an endpoint for fetching blocks) shall be added in subsequent proposals.

The newly exposed candid interface:

```candid
// Amount of ICP tokens, measured in 10^-8 of a token.
type ICP = record {
     e8s : nat64;
};

// Number of nanoseconds from the UNIX epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970).
type Timestamp = record {
    timestamp_nanos: nat64;
};

// AccountIdentifier is a 32-byte array.
// The first 4 bytes is big-endian encoding of a CRC32 checksum of the last 28 bytes.
type AccountIdentifier = blob;

// Subaccount is an arbitrary 32-byte byte array.
// Ledger uses subaccounts to compute the source address, which enables one
// principal to control multiple ledger accounts.
type SubAccount = blob;

// Sequence number of a block produced by the ledger.
type BlockIndex = nat64;

// An arbitrary number associated with a transaction.
// The caller can set it in a `transfer` call as a correlation identifier.
type Memo = nat64;

// Arguments for the `transfer` call.
type TransferArgs = record {
    // Transaction memo.
    // See comments for the `Memo` type.
    memo: Memo;
    // The amount that the caller wants to transfer to the destination address.
    amount: ICP;
    // The amount that the caller pays for the transaction.
    // Must be 10000 e8s.
    fee: ICP;
    // The subaccount from which the caller wants to transfer funds.
    // If null, the ledger uses the default (all zeros) subaccount to compute the source address.
    // See comments for the `SubAccount` type.
    from_subaccount: opt SubAccount;
    // The destination account.
    // If the transfer is successful, the balance of this account increases by `amount`.
    to: AccountIdentifier;
    // The point in time when the caller created this request.
    // If null, the ledger uses current IC time as the timestamp.
    created_at_time: opt Timestamp;
};

type TransferError = variant {
    // The fee that the caller specified in the transfer request was not the one that the ledger expects.
    // The caller can change the transfer fee to the `expected_fee` and retry the request.
    BadFee : record { expected_fee : ICP; };
    // The account specified by the caller doesn't have enough funds.
    InsufficientFunds : record { balance: ICP; };
    // The request is too old.
    // The ledger only accepts requests created within a 24 hours window.
    // This is a non-recoverable error.
    TxTooOld : record { allowed_window_nanos: nat64 };
    // The caller specified `created_at_time` that is too far in future.
    // The caller can retry the request later.
    TxCreatedInFuture : null;
    // The ledger has already executed the request.
    // `duplicate_of` field is equal to the index of the block containing the original transaction.
    TxDuplicate : record { duplicate_of: BlockIndex; };
};

type TransferResult = variant {
    Ok : BlockIndex;
    Err : TransferError;
};

// Arguments for the `account_balance` call.
type AccountBalanceArgs = record {
    account: AccountIdentifier;
};

service : {
  // Transfers tokens from a subaccount of the caller to the destination address.
  // The source address is computed from the principal of the caller and the specified subaccount.
  // When successful, returns the index of the block containing the transaction.
  transfer : (TransferArgs) -> (TransferResult);

  // Returns the amount of ICP on the specified account.
  account_balance : (AccountBalanceArgs) -> (ICP) query;
}
```
