examples apps would possibly include.  

1. sandbox for playing in and sharing alpha apps. 
2. apps that could create a 'home' directory of sorts for each new user and allow exploring each others 'home' pages.
3. apps that provide tools to learning development on the IC. 
4. apps that allows for better on-boarding of new users.
5. apps that could include forums, group-chat, message boards, job listings etc.
