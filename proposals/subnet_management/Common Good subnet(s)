Summary: propose 'common good' subnet(s) which host community-apps that are determined usefull to all the community.


usage examples/apps could possibly include:  
- sandbox for playing in and sharing alpha apps. 
- apps that could create a 'home' directory of sorts for each new user and allow exploring each others 'home' pages.
- apps that provide tools to learning development on the IC. 
- apps that allows for better on-boarding of new users.
- apps that could include forums, group-chat, message boards, job listings etc.

cycles could be provided without cost to new users and funded by the community at large.
